<h1 align="left"> Journey Through Java 🎯 </h1>

## A comprehensive guide to Java learning!

This repository is **my personal Java journal**, created to track everything I’m learning as I dive deeper into the Java ecosystem.

I’m **logging my daily progress** with **notes, syntax breakdowns, code examples, and real-world practice problems**—from **core Java basics** to **OOP, exception handling, collections, file handling**, and beyond.

It’s a daily reflection of everything I explore, structured and paced by me.
