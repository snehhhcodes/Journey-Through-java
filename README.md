<h1 align="left"> Journey Through Java 🎯 </h1>

## A comprehensive guide to Java learning!

This repository is **my personal Java journal**, created to track everything I’m learning as I dive deeper into the Java ecosystem.

I’m **logging my daily progress** by documenting the **topic I focused on, key concepts I learned, resources I used, questions I practiced, and detailed notes**—covering everything from **core Java basics to OOP, exception handling, collections and beyond**.

It’s a daily reflection of everything I explore, structured and paced by me.
